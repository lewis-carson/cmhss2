Specification
In this assignment, you will develop and critically evaluate at least one computational
model/method in addressing a humanities or social sciences problem of your choosing. You
will submit a written report describing your problem, data, implementation, and results, along
with documented code used to address your problem.
Instructions: Your submitted assignment consists of the following two items:
1. a written report of no more than 3000 words excluding figure captions and references
(*.PDF, A4, single-spaced, 12-point Times New Roman font, 1-inch margins) on one
or more computational models either from, or closely related to those discussed in, the
module; and
2. an archive (*.zip / *.tar.gz) containing the code for the implementation, including
instructions for how to run it in a README.txt file. If any data that your code relies
on is over 10Mb in size, please include instructions in this file for how to obtain it
rather than submitting the actual data. Your code is not marked separately but serves
as supporting evidence for the criteria indicated in the marking scheme.
Your report should:
1. Begin with a title and introduction where you clearly state which model(s)/method(s)
are used. No abstract is required.
2. Clearly state and motivate your chosen problem and research question(s). Provide
sufficient background information to contextualize this problem for the reader.
3. Document how your data was collected, and briefly state any relevant libraries or
toolkits that were used. Be sure that your dataset is appropriate for the given research
question and sufficient for the model(s)/method(s) employed.
4. Describe the computational model(s)/method(s) and your implementation.
5. Summarize your results.
6. Critically evaluate the model(s)/method(s) and your approach. This should involve
critical analysis of the adequacy of the modelling (e.g., what are the assumptions the
models rely on, and do they all hold; are there factors or biases that might invalidate
conclusions drawn, etc.), as well as comparison with external data and/or published
research on the topic. Note that use of more than one model/method and their
comparisons, as appropriately applied to your problem, will be more highly marked.
7. Discuss what conclusions can be drawn from the model.
Example Problem:
Based upon data from Wikidata, investigate the geographic distribution of places of birth of
UK members of parliament over time, from the first Parliament of the United Kingdom
(1801-1802) to the current parliament (2024-present). Use data obtained from Wikidata to
investigate:
• Regional biases: are there particular places or regions in which members of
parliament are more likely to have been born?
• Do these biases change in any interpretably meaningful ways over time?
• How adequate is the data collected from Wikidata for answering these questions?
In your assignment, please note that:
• You are allowed to reuse existing code, including open-source modules and toolkits,
Stack Overflow responses, code described in online tutorials, etc., provided that
whenever you do this, you clearly indicate what you have reused and where it came
from (including a URL for an online source). You should document smaller instances
of reuse (e.g., short code examples from Stack Overflow) as comments in your code,
and longer ones both in your code and as citations to the source in your report. Marks
will be awarded for the original parts of your work (i.e., your extensions to and
adaptations or developments of any reused material).
• Copying any material (this includes code and text) in your submission from any
source without clear acknowledgement may constitute plagiarism, which can have
serious consequences as described in the Teaching and Learning Handbook:
https://www.dur.ac.uk/learningandteaching.handbook/6/2/4/
• Marks will not be awarded under the “Technical depth/clarity of implementation”
sections for parts of your code that reimplement code available in widely used
libraries or modules.
• You may use any programming language suitable for your given problem, however,
use of Python is recommended.
• In writing your report, you should assume that the reader is you at the beginning of
the module. Concepts and techniques important to your implementation which were
not introduced during the module are encouraged but should be adequately explained.
